## 2. What is prompt engineering?

Prompt engineering is an essential practice when working with language models like those offered by Azure OpenAI. It revolves around the concept of creating, refining, and optimizing input prompts to elicit specific and desired outputs from these models.

### 2.1 Core concept

At its core, prompt engineering involves carefully crafting the input that you provide to a language model. The aim is to guide the model's output, making it more accurate, relevant, and aligned with the desired outcome.

### 2.2 Why it matters

Since language models generate text based on the prompts they receive, the quality, structure, and clarity of the prompt significantly affect the output. This is why prompt engineering is crucial for tasks that require high precision and contextual relevance.

## 3. Components of effective prompt engineering

### 3.1 Clarity

The prompt should be clear and unambiguous so that the model understands the task and generates relevant outputs.

### 3.2 Specificity

Providing detailed instructions within the prompt can help the model focus on what is most important, reducing the likelihood of irrelevant or off-topic responses.

### 3.3 Context

Adding context to the prompt can significantly improve the model’s ability to generate appropriate responses. Context can include background information, examples, or specific constraints.

### 3.4 Formatting

Specifying the format of the desired output (for example, bullet points, paragraphs, or a specific structure) can help guide the model to produce text that is easier to use.

## 4. Techniques in prompt engineering

### 4.1 Example-based prompting

Provide examples within the prompt to show the model what kind of response is expected. This is especially useful for complex tasks.

### 4.2 Zero-shot, few-shot, and many-shot prompting

Use no examples (zero-shot), a few examples (few-shot), or many examples (many-shot) to influence responses based on the number and quality of examples provided.

### 4.3 Iterative refinement

Continuously refine prompts based on the outputs generated by the model. This usually involves trial and error, tweaking the prompt to get closer to the desired output.

## 5. Best practices for text-based prompt engineering

### 5.1 Be explicit

The more explicit and detailed your prompt, the better the model can align its output with your expectations.

### 5.2 Test and iterate

Start with a basic prompt and refine it based on the results. Use iterative testing to improve the model’s performance.

### 5.3 Leverage context

Whenever possible, include context that can help the model understand the nuances of the task.

### 5.4 Monitor and adjust

Regularly monitor the outputs and adjust your prompts to address any inaccuracies or undesired behaviors.

> In the context of Azure OpenAI, prompt engineering is about using these techniques to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of AI-driven text generation, making it a powerful tool for developers and content creators alike.

## 6. Example prompts for hands-on practice

Use these prompts when trying out completions in Azure AI Studio, Postman, or your own code.

```text
Input: Please write a Happy Birthday wish for my mother.

Input: Give the top 5 food items from South India.

Input: Give the top 5 populated states in India.

Inputs:
1. Which is the tallest building in the world?
2. Which is the tallest building in Hyderabad?

Input: Tell me two jokes about simple people.

Input: Write a promotional email for a new wildlife rescue, including the following:
- Rescue name is Contoso
- It specializes in elephants, as well as zebras and giraffes
- Call for donations to be given at our website

Include a list of the current animals we have at our rescue after the signature, in the form of a table. These animals include elephants, zebras, gorillas, lizards, and jackrabbits.

### CoT

> 1. Chain of Thought (CoT) is a problem-solving approach that involves breaking down a complex problem into a series of smaller, logical steps or intermediate reasoning points. This method helps ensure a clear and systematic progression from the initial conditions to the final solution, enhancing accuracy and understanding by explicitly documenting the thought process at each stage.
> 1. Prompt designed to encourage the use of Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning.

```text
"Please solve the following problem using a Chain of Thought (CoT) approach, which involves breaking the problem down into smaller, logical steps to ensure a clear and systematic progression to the solution. Show each intermediate step and explain your reasoning."

Example Problem: "A bakery had 50 cupcakes. They sold 15 in the morning and then baked 20 more in the afternoon. How many cupcakes do they have now?"

**Expected CoT Response:**

1. Start with the initial number of cupcakes: 50.
2. Subtract the number of cupcakes sold in the morning: \( 50 - 15 = 35 \).
3. Add the number of cupcakes baked in the afternoon: \( 35 + 20 = 55 \).
4. The bakery now has 55 cupcakes.

```text
Q: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of
tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many
tennis balls does he have now?

A: Roger started with 5 balls. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls
each is 6 tennis balls. 5 + 6 = 11. The answer is 11.

Q: The cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20 to
make lunch and bought 6 more, how many apples
do they have?
