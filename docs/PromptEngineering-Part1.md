- Who wants better results without learning to code?

Today = 3 simple techniques to transform your AI interactions!"
```

### [2-7 min] DEMO 1: Bad vs Good Prompt

```text
Bad:  "Write about AI"
Good: "You are a technical writer. Write a 200-word intro to AI 
       for business executives. Focus on ROI. Use simple language."

👉 Show both in playground LIVE
💬 "Same model, 10x better output. That's prompt engineering!"
```

### [7-12 min] DEMO 2: Zero-Shot vs Few-Shot

```text
Zero-Shot: "Classify sentiment: 'Good product, slow delivery'"
Few-Shot:  Show 3 examples first, THEN classify

👉 Show accuracy difference
💬 "Examples teach the AI your specific criteria!"
```

### [12-17 min] DEMO 3: Chain of Thought

```text
Before: "Solve this math problem"
After:  "Solve step-by-step: 1) List what we know 2) Show calculations 3) Final answer"

## 🎤 SPEAKER NOTES - KEY TALKING POINTS

### Opening (2 min)

```
"Good morning everyone! Today we're diving into Prompt Engineering - 
the art and science of communicating effectively with AI models.

Think of it this way: AI models are incredibly powerful, but they need 
clear instructions. Just like asking a colleague for help - the better 
your question, the better the answer!"
```

### The WHY (1 min)

- **Problem:** Generic prompts = Generic results
- **Solution:** Engineered prompts = High-quality, specific outputs
- **Real Impact:** Same model, 10x better results with good prompts!

### Key Message
>
> "Prompt Engineering is not magic - it's a learnable skill that dramatically improves AI output quality."

---

## 💡 QUICK WINS TO DEMONSTRATE

### 1. Bad vs Good Prompt (Show This First!)

**❌ Bad Prompt:**

```
Write about AI
```

**✅ Good Prompt:**

```
You are a technical writer. Write a 200-word introduction to AI 
for business executives who have no technical background. 
Focus on practical benefits and use simple language.
```

**💡 Talking Point:** "Notice how specific the good prompt is - we defined role, length, audience, and tone!"

---

### 2. Zero-Shot vs Few-Shot (Live Demo)

**Zero-Shot (No Examples):**

```text
Classify the sentiment: "The product works well but delivery was slow"
```

**Few-Shot (With Examples):**

```text
Classify sentiment as Positive, Negative, or Mixed:

Example 1: "Great product!" → Positive
Example 2: "Terrible experience" → Negative  
Example 3: "Good quality, bad packaging" → Mixed

Now classify: "The product works well but delivery was slow"
```

**💡 Talking Point:** "Few-shot gives the model examples to learn from - much more accurate!"

---

### 3. Chain of Thought (CoT) - The Game Changer

**Without CoT:**

```text
If a train travels 120 miles in 2 hours, then 180 miles in 3 hours, 
what's its average speed?
```

**With CoT:**

```text
Solve step-by-step:

1. Calculate total distance
2. Calculate total time  
3. Divide distance by time
4. State the final answer

Problem: If a train travels 120 miles in 2 hours, then 180 miles 
in 3 hours, what's its average speed?
```

**💡 Talking Point:** "CoT forces the model to 'show its work' - reduces errors dramatically!"

---

## 🚀 LIVE DEMO SCRIPT

### Demo 1: Azure OpenAI Playground (5 min)

**Steps:**

1. Open Azure OpenAI Studio
2. Navigate to Chat Playground
3. Show system message configuration
4. Run these prompts live:

**Prompt 1 - Basic:**

```text
Write a tweet about prompt engineering
```

**Prompt 2 - Engineered:**

```text
You are a tech influencer with 100K followers.

Write a Twitter thread (3 tweets) about prompt engineering:
- Tweet 1: Hook that grabs attention
- Tweet 2: Main value/insight
- Tweet 3: Call-to-action

Use emojis, keep it under 280 chars per tweet, casual but professional tone.
```

**💬 Say:** "See the difference? Same model, but the engineered prompt gives us gold!"

---

### Demo 2: Role Play Power (3 min)

**Scenario:** Customer Support Bot

**Prompt:**

```text
You are a friendly customer support agent for "TechGadgets Store".

Guidelines:
- Be empathetic and helpful
- Offer specific solutions
- End with "Is there anything else I can help you with?"

Customer says: "My order hasn't arrived and it's been 2 weeks!"
```

**💬 Say:** "Notice how the role and guidelines shape the response tone and structure!"

---

### Demo 3: Code Generation (4 min)

**Show in Chat Playground:**

**Prompt:**

```text
You are a senior .NET developer.

Task: Generate C# code to connect to Azure OpenAI

Requirements:
- Use latest SDK patterns
- Include error handling
- Add XML documentation comments
- Follow SOLID principles

Show complete working example.
```

**💬 Say:** "The more specific we are, the better code we get. No generic examples!"

---

## 📊 TOKENS - QUICK EXPLANATION

### What to Show

1. Open: <https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer>
2. Type: "Hello, how are you?"
3. Show it's 6 tokens (not 4 words!)

### Key Points

```
💡 "Tokens ≠ Words"
- "Hello" = 1 token
- "GPT-4" = 3 tokens (G, PT, -4)
- Spaces and punctuation count!

💰 Why It Matters:
- You pay per token
- Models have token limits (e.g., 4K, 8K, 32K)
- Efficient prompts = Lower costs
```

## ⚡ TROUBLESHOOTING - IF DEMOS FAIL

### Backup Plan A: Use Screenshots

- Have screenshots of expected outputs ready
- "Here's what it typically looks like..."

### Backup Plan B: Pre-recorded Demo

- Quick video clip of the demo working
- "Let me show you what this looks like..."

### Backup Plan C: Live Code Alternative

- Switch to local code examples
- Run C# console app instead of playground

---

## 🎯 CLOSING STRONG (Last 3 Minutes)

### Key Takeaways Summary

```text
🎯 Remember These 3 Things:

1. **Be Specific** - Vague prompts = Vague results
   "Write a blog" → "Write a 500-word blog for developers about Azure AI"

2. **Use Examples** - Few-shot > Zero-shot  
   Show the AI what good looks like!

3. **Iterate & Improve** - First prompt rarely perfect
   Test → Analyze → Refine → Repeat

🚀 Start Small:
- Pick one task you do regularly
- Write a detailed prompt for it  
- Save it as a template
- Improve based on results
```

## 🎬 POST-DEMO Q&A - EXPECTED QUESTIONS

### Q1: "How much does Azure OpenAI cost?"

**A:** "Great question! Pricing is per 1000 tokens. For example, GPT-4 is ~$0.03 per 1K tokens. A typical conversation might be 500-1000 tokens, so quite affordable. Always check Azure pricing calculator for latest rates."

### Q2: "Can we use this in production?"

**A:** "Absolutely! Azure OpenAI is enterprise-ready with:

- SLA guarantees
- Data privacy (your data stays in your tenant)
- Compliance certifications
- Integration with Azure services"

### Q3: "What's the difference between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4?"

**A:** "GPT-4 is more accurate, better at reasoning, handles longer contexts (32K tokens vs 4K), but costs ~10x more. Use GPT-3.5 for simple tasks, GPT-4 for complex reasoning."

### Q4: "How do I get started?"

**A:** "Three steps:

1. Get Azure subscription
2. Request Azure OpenAI access (approval needed)
3. Deploy a model and start experimenting!
All details in Microsoft docs."

### Q5: "Can it replace developers?"

**A:** "No - it's a tool that makes developers MORE productive. Like calculators didn't replace mathematicians, AI won't replace developers. It handles routine tasks, freeing you for creative problem-solving!"

# Example 9: Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompt
Please solve the following problem using a Chain of Thought (CoT) approach, which involves breaking the problem down into smaller, logical steps to ensure a clear and systematic progression to the solution. Show each intermediate step and explain your reasoning.

Example Problem: "A bakery had 50 cupcakes. They sold 15 in the morning and then baked 20 more in the afternoon. How many cupcakes do they have now?"

**Expected CoT Response:**

1. Start with the initial number of cupcakes: 50.
2. Subtract the number of cupcakes sold in the morning: \( 50 - 15 = 35 \).
3. Add the number of cupcakes baked in the afternoon: \( 35 + 20 = 55 \).
4. The bakery now has 55 cupcakes.

Q: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now?
